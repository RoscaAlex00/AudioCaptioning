# CVSSP Audio Captioning System for DCASE challenges 2021 and 2022

## Set up environment

* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/XinhaoMei/DCASE2021_task6_v2.git`
* Create conda environment with dependencies: `conda env create -f environment.yml -n name`
* If you encounter with the `OSError: sndfile library not found `, please try `conda install -c conda-forge libsndfile`
* All of our experiments are running on RTX 3090 with CUDA11. This envirionment just works for RTX 30x GPUs.

## Set up dataset 

* Please refer to https://github.com/XinhaoMei/audio-text_retrieval
* Run `data_prep.py`  to prepare the h5py files

## Prepare evaluation tool

* Run `coco_caption/get_stanford_models.sh` to download the libraries necessary for evaluating the metrics.

## Run experiments 

### Cross-entropy training

* Set the parameters you want in `settings/settings.yaml` 
* Run experiments: `python train.py -n exp_name`

### Reinforcement learning training

* Set settings in `rl` block in `settings/settings.yaml` 
* Run: `python finetune_rl.py -n exp_name`
